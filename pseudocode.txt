2. Order Management


You’ll also build an order system where you can:
* Place a new order (it should check if enough stock is available before confirming)
* Cancel an order (if canceled, restore stock levels)
* List all orders
Each order should have:
* A unique order ID
* One or more items (product ID + quantity)
* Total price
* Status (pending, processed, or cancelled)
* Created timestamp

Additional Functionality
* Implement a polling mechanism that checks every 1 minute for orders that are still “pending” and automatically cancels them if they’re older than a minute.
* Add logging: any time a product is added, updated, or deleted, or an order is placed/cancelled, log it with a timestamp.


steps:


placing an order:

function place_order{
    look oredr details
    for loop for items in orders
    check the stock
    
    if quantity is not enough{
        return 'not enough stock'
    }
    order_id = math.random for unique ID
    for loop for order items:
    
    
    total=product with price multiplication

    orders[order_id] push the orders here

    subtract with the stock


    
    alert('oredr placed')
}
